# HaramBlur Extension

HaramBlur is a browser extension that allows you to navigate the web with respect for your Islamic values, privacy and reduce browsing distractions.

HaramBlur utilizes face detection and NSFW content detection and provides controls that allow you to uphold the Islamic gaze protection principle and tailor your online experience by automatically blurring images and videos that contain unwanted or impermissible content.

You can configure the type of detection you want and the amount of blur, the level of strictness, hover to unblur, choose a specific gender to blur, or turn the extension on and off via the interactive pop-up üòÑ

## Translations

- ‚Äé[ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä](ÿßŸÇÿ±ÿ£ŸÜŸä.md)

## Features

- Works on images and videos that contain unwanted or impermissible content
- Works on most (if not all) websites and social media platforms
- Configurable detection settings to tailor your browsing experience
- Interactive pop-up for easy on/off toggling
- Customizable hover to unblur feature
- Decent speed and accuracy (continously improved)

## How it Works

HaramBlur currently used face detection and recognition features provided by [Human library](https://github.com/vladmandic/human) to detect faces and blur them based on the user settings and preferences. It also uses NSFW detection provided by [nsfwjs](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs/) to further improve the accuracy. You can configure the type of detection you want and the amount of blur, hover to unblur, or turn the extension on and off via the interactive pop-up.
